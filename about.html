        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
            <p>I am currently exploring what life has to offer through all of its advancements.
        <br />I find myself fully immersed in the arts, and find it difficult to catch on
        <br /> to new medias of art. However, I am slowly learning and I have become more
        <br /> passionate about art in technology in the process. Art lead me towards coding
        <br /> which is what motivates me to try to update this website. </p>
