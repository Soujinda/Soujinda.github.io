        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
            <p>I am currently exploring what life has to offer through all of its advancements. I find myself fully immersed in the arts, and find it difficult to catch on to new medias of art. 
            However, I am slowly learning and have become more passionate about art in technology in the process. Art lead me towards coding which is what motivates me to try to update this website. </p>
