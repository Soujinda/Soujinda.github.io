        <h2>Life as Art</h2>
            <p>Welcome to "Life as Art". Here you will find some artwork that I have created during my passages through life and my own perspective about it.
            Life is a never ending journey and is different for each individual. No one has the exact same life, however there are times when the fates of two
            people collide.</p>
