        <h3>Favorite Anime</h3>
            <p> My all time favorite anime would have to be <em>Yuri on Ice</em>. The bonds and relationships that are conveyed, along with the art style bring tears to the viewers eyes.
            <em>Yuri on Ice</em> is an anime based on male figure skating and incorporates the blend of relationships within each performance that is created. The artist really captures
            the emotional aspect that figure skaters tend to have. Some skaters who have seen <em>Yuri on Ice</em> agree that it is such an amazing anime to binge watch.</p>
